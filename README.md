jsonbench
=========

Welcome to the `jsonbench` documentation.

## Description

The purpose of this tool is to compare the performance of different JSON C libraries and to show what to expect from a possible alternative JSON processor. For more details, take a look at the tool's source. Currently, mod_security2 and libmodsecurity3 use YAJL for JSON processing. Unfortunately, this library is deprecated and is no longer supported by its maintainer.

Note that mod_security2 processes JSON and creates keys and values. Keys are the names of the JSON keys and values ​​are their values. If the JSON object is an array, the key will be the string `array`. For multidimensional arrays, the key is `array.array.....`.

## Requirements

To compile the code you need the any of these JSON C libraries (hopefully this will be expand):
* yajl

To install them, try these commands:

```bash
sudo apt install libyajl-dev libyajl2
```

You also need `autoconf`, `automake`, `autotools-dev`, `make` and `gcc` or `clang` packages:

```bash
sudo apt install autoconf automake autotools-dev make gcc
```

## Build

Download and unpack the source, and run these commands

```bash
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
```
If you don't want to use any available JSON library, you can ignore it, eg:
```bash
./configure --wit-yajl=no
```

### Other `configure` flags:
For the complete list, please type `./configure --help`.

Relevant flags:
```
  --with-file-buffer-size=SIZE
                          Set buffer size (default: 524288 bytes (512kB))
  --with-json-string-size=SIZE
                          Set buffer size for JSON strings (key, values)
                          (default: 2048 bytes (2kB))
```
I didn't want to use dynamic strings and use `malloc()`/`calloc()`, therefore I used static length buffer in every cases. With these options, you can set the buffer's size.

The `--with-file-buffer-size` describes how big file you want to process. The default value is 512kB.

The `--with-json-string-size` describes how long can be a processed json key and value. The default value is 2kB. You can owervrite these values with these options. The values are in bytes.

## Run

To run the tool, type:
```bash
src/jsonbench -h
```

Or if you want to try a parser:
```bash
src/jsonbench -e yajl
```

### Other command line flags

`src/jsonbench -h` gives a full list of available options. Here is a detailed review:

* `-e` sets the JSON engine (if there is any). Currently the tool supports only YAJL, so you can pass `-e YAJL` (with capital letters).
* `-d` sets the maximum depth of the JSON strcture. The default value is 500. This option is the same as the [SecRequestBodyJsonDepthLimit](https://github.com/owasp-modsecurity/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual-(v2.x)#user-content-SecRequestBodyJsonDepthLimit) in ModSecurity. When the processor reached this limit with the processed depth, the tool terminates with error.
* `-a` sets the maximum size of arguments. The default value is 500. This option is the same as the [SecArgumentsLimit](https://github.com/owasp-modsecurity/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual-(v2.x)#secargumentslimit) in ModSecurity. When the processor reached this limit with the processed arguments, the tool terminates with error.
* `-s` keeps the tool in silence, and don't print out the processed data. This can be help to measure the performance more accurate.

### Example

```
src/jsonbench -e YAJL -a 10000 -s tests/512KB.json 

Time: 0.002567988 usec
```
This command processes the file `tests/512KB.json` and prints out the total time of JSON processing. Eg. this does not include the file processing.

```
src/jsonbench -e YAJL -a 10000 tests/test06.json 
array.array.id: 2489651045
array.array.type: CreateEvent
array.array.actor.id: 665991
array.array.actor.login: petroav
array.array.actor.gravatar_id: 
array.array.actor.url: https://api.github.com/users/petroav
array.array.actor.avatar_url: https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/665991?
array.array.repo.id: 28688495
array.array.repo.name: petroav/6.828
array.array.repo.url: https://api.github.com/repos/petroav/6.828
array.array.payload.ref: master
array.array.payload.ref_type: branch
array.array.payload.master_branch: master
...
array.array.public: true
array.array.created_at: 2015-01-01T15:00:01Z

Time: 0.000747715 usec
```
This command process the file `tests/test06.json` and prints out the processed keys and values. The syntax is the same as in case of mod_security2 JSON processing.

## TODO

Add more possible JSON processors.
